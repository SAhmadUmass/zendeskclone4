**Below is a concise guide to fixing the “cookies() should be awaited” error and ensuring that Supabase can properly read your session within your Next.js route.**  

Because you’re using Next.js 13+ (and the new 15.x references in the logs), the built-in functions such as `cookies()` now need to be called asynchronously in many cases. If you try to use them synchronously, you’ll see the warning:

• “Route … used cookies().get(…). cookies() should be awaited before using its value.”  

This typically causes Supabase to fail when it attempts to parse the auth cookie, leading to the 401 or 400 “Auth session missing!” error.

--------------------------------------
## 1. How to Fix the Route Handler
--------------------------------------

In your “convert-to-staff” route (currently):

```typescript
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    console.log('1. Starting auth process...')

    // Create a client for auth using the auth helper
    // PROBLEM: cookies() is being used synchronously here
    const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })
    ...
  } catch (error) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Instead, do two things:

1. Await the cookies before creating the client.  
2. Pass them to `createRouteHandlerClient` as a function that returns the already-fetched cookie store.  

Below is an updated example:

```typescript
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    console.log('1. Starting auth process...')

    // 1) Await cookies here
    const cookieStore = await cookies()

    // 2) Pass the cookie store into createRouteHandlerClient
    const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient(
      { cookies: () => cookieStore },
      {
        supabaseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
        supabaseKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
      }
    )

    console.log('2. Getting user session...')
    const {
      data: { user },
      error: userError,
    } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

    console.log('3. User session result:', {
      hasUser: !!user,
      userId: user?.id,
      error: userError
        ? { message: userError.message, status: userError.status }
        : null,
    })

    if (userError || !user) {
      console.error('4. Auth error:', userError || 'No user found')
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Authentication error', details: userError?.message || 'No user found' },
        { status: 401 }
      )
    }

    // Now create or use an admin client if you need elevated privileges:
    const adminClient = createClient(
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
      process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
    )

    // Next, check the admin role, etc. Same as before...
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    ...
  }
}
```

► You would then keep the rest of your “admin client” logic the same (for checking the user’s role and performing the row update).

--------------------------------------
## 2. Why This Fixes Your 401
--------------------------------------

• In Next.js 13+ (and especially 15+), the system marks certain APIs like `cookies()` as “dynamic APIs” that must be awaited in a server environment.  
• Without `await`, the underlying logic grabbing the cookie from the request can’t run in time, so `createRouteHandlerClient` tries to parse a null or invalid auth token.  
• That leads to “Auth session missing,” making Supabase think the user is unauthenticated.

By awaiting `cookies()` and then passing them in, you ensure that Supabase sees the correct cookie string and can decode it properly into a valid session.

--------------------------------------
## 3. Double Check Middleware & Admin Auth
--------------------------------------

• Your middleware logs show that you can indeed read the user’s ID correctly in middleware. That means the user’s cookie is valid at that layer.  
• If your route returns 401 after putting this fix in, ensure that the user is actually an “admin” in the database. Otherwise, your logic intentionally blocks them with a 403 or 401 if they aren’t admin.  
• Continue using a separate “adminClient” with the service role key for the actual row update, since that’s what bypasses RLS for truly privileged updates (like promoting another user).

--------------------------------------
## 4. Summarizing the Key Point
--------------------------------------

**Use “await cookies()” in route handlers.** Then pass that pre-fetched store into `createRouteHandlerClient`. This eliminates the “Route … used cookies()…” error and ensures your Supabase session is properly read so your user won’t appear unauthenticated.

That’s it! Once you do this, you should finally get rid of the 401 error on “convert-to-staff” (assuming the user is indeed allowed to make that change).
