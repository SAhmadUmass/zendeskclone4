# Ticket Summarization Feature - Context Transition

## Context Summary
Implemented automatic ticket summarization when tickets are marked as resolved. The system listens for status changes in real-time, generates a summary using GPT-3.5-turbo, and saves it back to the ticket record.

## Key Components

### 1. Realtime Subscription (app/admin-dashboard/components/resolved-tickets-realtime.tsx)
```typescript
// Listens for ticket status changes to 'resolved'
const channel = supabase
  .channel('resolved-tickets')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'requests'
    },
    (payload) => {
      if (payload.old.status !== 'resolved' && payload.new.status === 'resolved') {
        onTicketResolved?.(payload.new)
      }
    }
  )
```

### 2. Summarization Handler (app/admin-dashboard/resolved-tickets.tsx)
```typescript
// Handles resolved ticket events and triggers summarization
const handleTicketResolved = (ticket: Ticket) => {
  toast.success('Ticket Resolved')
  void (async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/tickets/${ticket.id}/summarize`, {
      method: 'POST',
      credentials: 'include'
    })
    // ... handle response
  })()
}
```

### 3. Summarization API (app/api/tickets/[id]/summarize/route.ts)
- Uses service role key to bypass RLS
- Fetches ticket and messages
- Generates summary using LangChain and GPT-3.5
- Updates ticket record with summary

## Database Schema
- requests table: id, title, description, status, summary
- messages table: id, request_id, content, sender_id, sender_type

## Key Learnings
1. Realtime subscriptions need careful event filtering
   - Don't filter in subscription, check payload changes instead
   - Compare old and new status values

2. Auth and RLS Management
   - Service role key needed for admin operations
   - Keep auth handling in middleware
   - Don't mix auth contexts in API routes

3. Error Handling and UX
   - Immediate toast feedback for status change
   - Separate toast for summary generation
   - Detailed error messages in development

4. Next.js Best Practices
   - Proper cookie handling in API routes
   - Await params in Next.js 15
   - Use credentials: 'include' for auth

## Next Steps
1. Monitor summary quality and adjust prompts if needed
2. Consider adding summary editing capability
3. Add summary display in ticket UI
4. Consider rate limiting for large ticket volumes

None currently. All major issues resolved:
- Fixed realtime subscription filtering
- Resolved auth context issues
- Fixed message retrieval with service role
