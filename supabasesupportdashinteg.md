# Step-by-Step Plan for Integrating Supabase into Your Support Dashboard

Below is a series of atomic steps to guide a junior developer through connecting the “support-dashboard” pages to Supabase. This plan assumes you’re primarily querying Supabase directly from your components. Additionally, you might create custom API routes in special cases that require more complex logic or external integrations.

---

## 1. Confirm Environment Variables & Configuration
• Objective: Ensure the Supabase URL and Anon Key are correctly set up in your environment.  
• Files to check or create:  
  – .env.local (for storing NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY).  
  – supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseClient.ts, utils/supabase/client.ts, etc. (make sure these read from the correct environment variables).  

• Example Pseudocode (structure for your .env.local file):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

---

## 2. Validate Database Tables and RLS Policies
• Objective: Confirm that your Supabase project has the required tables (e.g., “requests,” “profiles,” “customers”) and that Row-Level Security (RLS) is in place.  
• In the Supabase Dashboard:  
  – Check the “requests” table for columns like id, title, description, customer_id, status, etc.  
  – Ensure you have RLS policies for your roles (e.g., “customer,” “support,” “admin”).  

• If you need a “customers” table separate from “profiles,” set that up too. Make sure columns (name, email, status) match your code’s expectations.

---

## 3. Decide Which Pages Will Query Supabase Directly
• Objective: Identify where you’ll fetch data.  
• Files to review under app/support-dashboard:  
  – page.tsx (main Dashboard), analytics/page.tsx, customers/page.tsx, tickets/page.tsx, settings/page.tsx.  
• For each page or nested component, determine if it requires data from Supabase.  

• Tip:  
  – If it’s simple data (like listing customers or tickets) that’s specific to one page, query Supabase right in that page component.  
  – If multiple pages need the same data logic, consider a shared helper or custom hook.

---

## 4. Set Up the Supabase Client
• Objective: Ensure you have a straightforward way to instantiate the Supabase client.  
• Files to reference:  
  – utils/supabase/client.ts (for client-side components, if needed).  
  – utils/supabase/server.ts (or supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseServer.ts) if you want to do server-side queries for Next.js server components.

• Example Pseudocode (client usage):
```
import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/client"

function MyClientComponent() {
  const supabase = createClient()
  // Supabase queries here...
}
```

---

## 5. Query the Database in Client or Server Components
• Objective: Decide if you’ll use a client component (with “use client” at the top) or a server component.  
• Guidelines:  
  – For dynamic features, user-driven interactions, or real-time subscriptions, use client components with the client Supabase instance.  
  – For initial page rendering or SSR, you can use server components with createServerClient (or createClient from the server utility).

• Files to modify:  
  – app/support-dashboard/customers/page.tsx could remain a client component if you plan to do interactive editing.  
  – app/support-dashboard/tickets/page.tsx is also client-based if you want filters or real-time updates.  
  – If you prefer SSR for some pages (e.g., analytics), you could make analytics/page.tsx a server component.

---

## 6. Fetch Your Data (e.g., Customers, Tickets)
• Objective: In the desired page, write a small function to retrieve the data from the appropriate table.  
• Steps:  
  1. Import and initialize Supabase.  
  2. Call supabase.from("your_table").select(...).  
  3. Handle any errors gracefully (e.g., if RLS blocks access).  

• Example Pseudocode:
```
async function loadCustomers() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("customers")
    .select("*")
    .eq("status", "active")

  if (error) {
    // handle error
  }

  return data
}
```

---

## 7. Replace Dummy Data with Live Queries
• Objective: In places like app/support-dashboard/customers/page.tsx (currently using dummyCustomers), switch to real data from Supabase.  
• Steps:  
  1. Remove or comment out the dummy data array.  
  2. Use a useEffect or onMount logic (in a client component) to fetch actual customers from the DB.  
  3. Store those results in state (e.g., setCustomers).  

• Remember: If you have RLS that restricts certain roles, ensure your logged-in user has permissions to read/write “customers.”

---

## 8. Implement CRUD Functionality (Optional)
• Objective: If you need to create, update, or delete records, incorporate those interactions directly in your client components or via custom /api endpoints.  
• Logic for direct updates:
  1. In a client component, call supabase.from("customers").update(...).eq("id", customer.id).  
  2. If you want advanced server-side logic, create an endpoint in app/api/customers/route.ts that does the update. Then fetch that endpoint from your client.  

• Critical Files:  
  – If you do build /api routes: app/api/tickets/route.ts, app/api/customers/route.ts, etc.  
  – If you stick with direct queries, do the update logic in your page or a shared hook.

---

## 9. Integrate RLS Testing
• Objective: Ensure your RLS policies work and you aren’t returning data for unauthorized users.  
• Steps:  
  1. Log in as a “customer” user (with a limited role) and confirm they only see their own tickets.  
  2. Log in as an “admin” user and confirm they see all tickets.  
  3. Check browser console or logs for supabase errors (like “permission denied for relation”).

---

## 10. Consider Real-Time Updates
• Objective: If you want instant changes (like new ticket notifications), set up subscriptions.  
• Typically done in a client component:
```
const channel = supabase
  .channel("realtime:requests")
  .on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", schema: "public", table: "requests" }, (payload) => {
    // handle new/updated rows
  })
  .subscribe()
```
• This is optional unless you specifically need a live feed.

---

## 11. (Optional) Decide When to Use Custom API Routes
• Objective: Some operations might need complex business logic or to serve external systems.  
• Steps:  
  1. Create an endpoint in app/api/tickets/[id]/route.ts if you have non-trivial transformations or if external tools must call your routes.  
  2. Inside that file, use the server-side Supabase client to read/write the DB.  
  3. Return JSON responses for external usage.  

• This is helpful if you need more robust validation or want a standard REST endpoint for other integrations.

---

## 12. Final Testing & Deployment
• Objective: Validate your entire flow in development, then push to production.  
• Steps:  
  1. Confirm .env.local is set in production or environment variables are configured in your hosting platform.  
  2. Deploy your Next.js + Supabase stack.  
  3. Test all “@support-dashboard” pages (Dashboard, Tickets, Customers, Analytics, Settings).  
  4. Verify logs for any Supabase permission issues.  

---

## Critical Files Recap
• app/support-dashboard/* (your main dashboard pages).  
• utils/supabase/client.ts or supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseClient.ts (Supabase client for client components).  
• utils/supabase/server.ts or supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseServer.ts (Supabase client for server components).  
• app/api/* (any custom REST endpoints if you choose to add them).  
• .env.local (Supabase project URL and keys).  
• Supabase Dashboard (table schemas, RLS policies, logs).

---

### Conclusion
By following these atomic steps, a junior developer can confidently integrate Supabase queries directly into the “support-dashboard” pages for reading and writing data. In scenarios where you require additional logic or external integrations, you can create custom Next.js /api routes without disrupting the core flow. This mixed approach balances simplicity, security, and scalability.
