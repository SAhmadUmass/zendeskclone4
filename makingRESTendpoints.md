**Plan: Implement Basic REST API Endpoints (Atomic Steps)**

Below is a step-by-step outline for a junior developer to create Basic REST API endpoints in a Next.js + Supabase project. You won’t see actual code here, just high-level guidance and optional pseudocode. Where code might be helpful, it’s mentioned in a generic format without line numbers.

---

## 1. Identify Your Resources and Endpoints

• Decide the resources you will expose via your REST API. For example:  
  – /tickets for Ticket CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
  – /users (if you need a formal user management endpoint).  
  – /auth (optional, if you want custom routes for authentication—though Supabase’s built-in auth may suffice).  

• Confirm which fields each resource needs (e.g., title, description, priority for tickets).

---

## 2. Create Folders for Route Handlers

• In Next.js (App Router), each folder under app/api/<resource> corresponds to an endpoint.  
• For instance:  
  – app/api/tickets/route.ts → handles /api/tickets (GET for list, POST for creation).  
  – app/api/tickets/[id]/route.ts → handles /api/tickets/:id (GET, PUT, DELETE for a specific record).  

• Critical Files:  
  – app/api/tickets/route.ts (the main listing/creation endpoint).  
  – app/api/tickets/[id]/route.ts (the single-item endpoint logic).  
  – If you also want user management, do similarly in app/api/users.  

---

## 3. Set Up Database Access in Each Handler

• Use your Supabase client in server-side code.  
• Typical steps inside each route file:  
  1. Authenticate the request (e.g., supabase.auth.getUser()).  
  2. Parse any incoming data (if POST or PUT).  
  3. Perform the required database operation (select, insert, update, or delete).  
  4. Return a JSON response (ticket data or an error).  

• Critical Files:  
  – utils/supabase/server.ts or a similar server-side client utility.  
  – middleware.ts for any global or role-based checks if you prefer a centralized approach.

---

## 4. Apply Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies If Needed

• If you only want certain roles to access or modify data, confirm that your Supabase “requests” (or “tickets”) table has the correct RLS policies.  
• Typical checks:  
  – Owners can only see or edit their own tickets.  
  – “support” role can see or edit tickets assigned to them.  
  – “admin” can see or edit all tickets.  

• Optional Pseudocode for a policy idea (no real code):
  
  ```
  CREATE POLICY "Allow user to read own tickets"
    ON public.requests
    FOR SELECT
    USING (customer_id = auth.uid());
  ```

• Critical Locations:  
  – Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → requests → RLS.  
  – You can also store policy definitions in SQL scripts if you maintain them in your repo.

---

## 5. Test Each Endpoint Locally

• Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to verify every route:  
  – GET /api/tickets → Should return an array of tickets (or filtered if user is not an admin).  
  – POST /api/tickets → Should create a new ticket in the database.  
  – GET /api/tickets/123 → Should return ticket #123 if the user can access it.  
  – PUT /api/tickets/123 → Should update ticket #123 if the user is authorized.  
  – DELETE /api/tickets/123 → Should remove ticket #123 if the user is authorized (optional).  

• Make sure RLS is correctly disallowing data that shouldn’t be returned.  
• Double-check that errors come back with helpful messages (e.g., “Unauthorized,” “Not Found,” “Invalid Input,” etc.).

---

## 6. Document the Endpoints

• For a junior dev, emphasize the importance of documenting:  
  1. Each route path (e.g., POST /api/tickets).  
  2. The payload shape (fields required for POST or PUT).  
  3. The possible responses (success and error).  

• Put this in your project’s README, a dedicated API.md file, or any wiki. This makes life easier for future devs or third-party integrations.

---

## 7. (Optional) Add Role-Based Checks in Code

• If you want to do role checks inside route handlers (in addition to or instead of RLS), do the following:  
  1. Query the “profiles” table to get the user’s role.  
  2. If role !== 'admin', for example, skip or limit certain functionality.  
  3. Return an error if the user is not allowed to perform an action.  

• Where to place these checks:  
  – Directly in the route handler (app/api/tickets/*).  
  – In a global middleware (for broader usage).

---

## 8. Deploy and Validate in Production

• When deploying, ensure environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, etc.) are set properly.  
• Check Supabase’s production RLS rules. They might differ from development if you made changes.  
• Verify logs for any errors or permission denials once live.  

---

## 9. Maintain and Extend

• Over time, consider adding:  
  – Additional routes (like /api/users for user management).  
  – Detailed validations (use libraries like Joi, zod, or yup).  
  – Pagination, sorting, or advanced filters.  
  – Real-time subscriptions instead of REST if you need live updates.

---

### Critical Files Recap

• app/api/tickets/route.ts (handles list + create).  
• app/api/tickets/[id]/route.ts (handles read, update, delete).  
• middleware.ts (optional for role-based checks).  
• utils/supabase/server.ts (or wherever your server-side Supabase client is set up).  
• .env.local (for environment variables like Supabase project URL and keys).

**By following these steps in small increments, a junior developer can confidently build out the fundamental REST endpoints for your Next.js + Supabase application.**
