# Dashboard Restructuring Documentation

## Overview
Reorganized the application structure to clearly separate customer-facing and support staff interfaces, following Next.js 13+ app router conventions and best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
```
app/
├── layout.tsx           # Root layout (global styles, fonts)
├── customer-dashboard/  # Customer interface
│   ├── layout.tsx      
│   ├── tickets/        # Ticket management
│   └── profile/        # User profile
└── support-dashboard/  # Support staff interface
    ├── layout.tsx     
    ├── overview/      # Dashboard metrics
    ├── tickets/       # Ticket management
    ├── analytics/     # Analytics views
    ├── customers/     # Customer management
    └── settings/      # System settings
```

### 2. Component Organization
```
src/components/
├── ui/                       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── button.tsx
│   ├── input.tsx
│   └── ...
└── support-dashboard/        # Support dashboard specific
    ├── sidebar.tsx
    └── tickets-table.tsx
```

### 3. Layout Structure
- Root layout (`app/layout.tsx`): Global styles, fonts
- Customer dashboard layout: Customer-specific navigation and UI
- Support dashboard layout: Admin navigation and UI

### 4. Key Changes
1. Renamed `/dashboard` to `/customer-dashboard`
2. Created new `/support-dashboard` section
3. Separated components by feature area
4. Implemented nested layouts for different sections

### 5. Best Practices Implemented
- Clear separation of concerns between interfaces
- Feature-based component organization
- Proper use of Next.js 13+ app router
- Nested layouts for different sections

## Next Steps
1. Implement auth middleware for route protection
2. Add loading and error states
3. Create shared component library
4. Implement TypeScript interfaces for shared data

## Migration Notes
- Updated import paths in existing components
- Maintained existing customer dashboard functionality
- Removed duplicate style imports
- Simplified layout structure
