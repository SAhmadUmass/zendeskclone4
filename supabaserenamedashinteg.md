# Step-by-Step Plan for Integrating Supabase into Your Admin Dashboard

Below is a comprehensive series of atomic steps to guide a junior developer through connecting the `admin-dashboard` pages to Supabase. This plan assumes you're primarily querying Supabase directly from your components. Additionally, you might create custom API routes in special cases that require more complex logic or external integrations.

---

## 1. Confirm Environment Variables & Configuration

**Objective:** Ensure the Supabase URL and Anon Key are correctly set up in your environment.

**Files to Check or Create:**

- `.env.local` (for storing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
- `supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseClient.ts`, `utils/supabase/client.ts`, etc. (make sure these read from the correct environment variables).

**Example Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

---

## 2. Validate Database Tables and RLS Policies

**Objective:** Confirm that your Supabase project has the required tables (e.g., "requests," "profiles," "customers," "users," etc.) and that Row-Level Security (RLS) is in place.

**Steps:**

1. **Check Existing Tables:**
   - Verify tables like `requests`, `profiles`, `customers` exist with necessary columns.
  
2. **Add Admin-Specific Tables (If Needed):**
   - For the admin dashboard, you might need additional tables such as `support_staff`, `roles`, etc.
  
3. **Configure RLS Policies:**
   - Ensure RLS policies are defined to restrict data access based on user roles ("admin," "support," "customer").
   - Example policies:
     - **Support Staff** can view and manage tickets assigned to them.
     - **Admins** have full access to all data.

**Reference:**
- Supabase [RLS Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security)

---

## 3. Decide Which Pages Will Query Supabase Directly

**Objective:** Identify where you'll fetch data within the admin dashboard.

**Admin Dashboard Pages:**

- `app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx` (Dashboard Overview)
- `app/admin-dashboard/priorities/page.tsx`
- `app/admin-dashboard/tickets/page.tsx`
- `app/admin-dashboard/users/page.tsx`

**Steps:**

1. **For Each Page or Nested Component:**
   - Determine if it requires data from Supabase.
  
2. **Decide on Data Fetching Strategy:**
   - **Simple Data:** Query Supabase directly in the page component.
   - **Shared Logic:** Use shared helpers or custom hooks if multiple pages require the same data logic.

**Tip:**
- Consider the complexity and reusability of data fetching logic when deciding where to place queries.

---

## 4. Set Up the Supabase Client

**Objective:** Ensure you have a straightforward way to instantiate the Supabase client for the admin dashboard.

**Files to Reference:**

- `utils/supabase/client.ts` (for client-side components).
- `src/utils/supabase/server.ts` (for server-side queries, Next.js server components).

**Example Pseudocode (Client Usage):**

```plaintext
import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/client"

function MyClientComponent() {
  const supabase = createClient()
  // Supabase queries here...
}
```

---

## 5. Query the Database in Client or Server Components

**Objective:** Decide whether to use client components or server components for data fetching.

**Guidelines:**

- **Client Components:**
  - Use for dynamic features, user-driven interactions, or real-time subscriptions.
  - Instantiate Supabase client on the client side.
  
- **Server Components:**
  - Use for initial page rendering or Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
  - Instantiate Supabase client on the server side.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Component Type:**
   - Add "use client" directive at the top of client components.
  
2. **Instantiate Supabase Client Accordingly:**
   - Use `createClient` from `client.ts` for client components.
   - Use `createServerClient` from `server.ts` for server components.

---

## 6. Implement Data Fetching for Admin Dashboard

**Admin Dashboard:**

- **Fetching User Data:**
  - Query all users, support staff, and their roles.
  
- **Fetching Ticket Metrics:**
  - Aggregate data such as total tickets, active users, high-priority tickets.

**Pseudocode Example for Fetching Ticket Metrics:**

```plaintext
async function getTicketMetrics() {
  const supabase = await createClient()

  const [totalResult, openResult, highPriorityResult] = await Promise.all([
    supabase.from('requests').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }),
    supabase.from('requests').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }).eq('status', 'open'),
    supabase.from('requests')
      .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
      .eq('priority', 'high')
      .is('assigned_to', null)
  ])

  return {
    total: totalResult.count ?? 0,
    open: openResult.count ?? 0,
    needingAttention: highPriorityResult.count ?? 0
  }
}
```

---

## 7. Replace Dummy Data with Live Queries

**Objective:** Replace any mock or dummy data in your components with real data fetched from Supabase.

**Admin Dashboard:**

- **Example:**
  - In `app/admin-dashboard/users/page.tsx`, replace `initialUsers` with live data from Supabase.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Dummy Data Usage:**
   - Locate components using mock data.
  
2. **Fetch Real Data:**
   - Use `useEffect` or equivalent hooks to fetch data on component mount.
  
3. **Store Data in State:**
   - Utilize `useState` to manage fetched data within the component.

**Remember:**
- Ensure RLS policies are correctly set to allow the logged-in user to access the necessary data.

---

## 8. Implement CRUD Functionality (Optional)

**Objective:** Enable create, read, update, and delete operations for resources within the admin dashboard.

**Admin Dashboard:**

- Manage users, support staff roles, ticket priorities, and assignments.

**Steps:**

1. **Direct Queries:**
   - Implement Supabase queries directly within client components for simple CRUD operations.

2. **Custom API Routes:**
   - For more complex operations, create custom API endpoints under `app/api/admin-dashboard/` to handle business logic securely.

3. **Update UI Accordingly:**
   - Reflect changes in the UI by updating state based on CRUD operations.

**Critical Files:**

- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - `app/admin-dashboard/users/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin-dashboard/priorities/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin-dashboard/tickets/page.tsx`

---

## 9. Integrate RLS Testing

**Objective:** Ensure your RLS policies work correctly, preventing unauthorized data access.

**Steps:**

1. **Log in as Different Roles:**
   - Test as an "admin," "support," and "customer" to verify access levels.

2. **Confirm Data Visibility:**
   - Ensure each role can only access the data they're permitted to view or modify.
  
3. **Check for Permission Errors:**
   - Monitor browser console and Supabase logs for any "permission denied" errors.

---

## 10. Consider Real-Time Updates

**Objective:** Implement real-time data synchronization for dynamic dashboards.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Subscriptions:**
   - Use Supabase's real-time features to listen for changes in relevant tables (e.g., `requests`, `messages`).

2. **Update UI in Real-Time:**
   - Reflect changes immediately in the UI without requiring a page refresh.

3. **Handle Subscriptions Cleanup:**
   - Ensure subscriptions are properly cleaned up when components unmount to prevent memory leaks.

**Example Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
const channel = supabase
  .channel("realtime:requests")
  .on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", schema: "public", table: "requests" }, (payload) => {
    // handle new/updated rows
  })
  .subscribe()
```

---

## 11. (Optional) Decide When to Use Custom API Routes

**Objective:** Utilize custom API routes for operations requiring advanced business logic or external integrations.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Complex Operations:**
   - Determine which actions cannot be handled directly by client-side Supabase queries.
  
2. **Create Custom Routes:**
   - Set up endpoints under `app/api/admin-dashboard/` for these operations.
  
3. **Implement Server-Side Logic:**
   - Use server-side Supabase clients to interact with the database securely within these routes.
  
4. **Consume API Routes from the Frontend:**
   - Make fetch requests from your frontend components to these custom API endpoints as needed.

**Critical Files:**

- `app/api/admin-dashboard/users/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin-dashboard/priorities/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin-dashboard/tickets/route.ts`

---

## 12. Final Testing & Deployment

**Objective:** Validate your entire integration flow in development before deploying to production.

**Steps:**

1. **Confirm Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is correctly set in production or environment variables are configured in your hosting platform.
  
2. **Deploy Your Next.js + Supabase Stack:**
   - Use your preferred deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).
  
3. **Test All Dashboard Pages:**
   - Verify functionality across the admin dashboard, including CRUD operations and real-time updates.
  
4. **Monitor Logs for Errors:**
   - Check Supabase logs and your application's error monitoring tools for any permission or runtime issues.

---

## Critical Files Recap

**Admin Dashboard:**

- `app/admin-dashboard/*` (main admin dashboard pages)
- `utils/supabase/client.ts` or `supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseClient.ts` (Supabase client for client components)
- `src/utils/supabase/server.ts` or `supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseServer.ts` (Supabase client for server components)
- `app/api/admin-dashboard/*` (custom REST endpoints for admin operations)
- `.env.local` (Supabase project URL and keys)
- Supabase Dashboard (table schemas, RLS policies, logs)

---

### Conclusion

By following these atomic steps, a junior developer can confidently integrate Supabase queries directly into the `admin-dashboard` pages for reading and writing data. This comprehensive approach ensures that the admin interface is secure, scalable, and maintainable, leveraging Supabase's powerful features alongside Next.js best practices.

In scenarios where you require additional logic or external integrations, creating custom Next.js `/api` routes allows for extending functionality without disrupting the core flow. This mixed approach balances simplicity, security, and scalability across the admin dashboard.
