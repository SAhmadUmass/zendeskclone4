# Real-Time Notifications Implementation - Context Transition

## Context Summary
Implemented real-time notifications for the admin dashboard to alert staff when tickets are marked as resolved. This feature enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback on ticket status changes.

## Key Problems
1. Need for immediate notification when tickets are resolved
2. Handling real-time updates securely (admin/support only)
3. Type safety with Supabase real-time payloads
4. Toast notification integration

## Solution Progress

### Implemented Components
1. `ResolvedTicketsRealtime`
   - Subscribes to Supabase real-time updates
   - Filters for 'resolved' status changes
   - Includes role-based authorization check
   - Type guards for payload validation

2. `ResolvedTicketsNotifier`
   - Handles toast notifications
   - Displays ticket title and status change
   - Mounted in admin dashboard

### Database Changes
- Added RLS policy for real-time subscriptions:
```sql
create policy "Allow staff to subscribe to request changes"
on requests for select
to authenticated
using (
  auth.uid() in (
    select id from profiles 
    where role in ('admin', 'support')
  )
);
```

### Current Status
✅ Real-time subscription working
✅ Role-based access control implemented
✅ Toast notifications appearing correctly
✅ Type safety ensured with proper guards

### Blocking Issues
None currently. All major issues resolved:
- Fixed type guard to use `created_at` instead of `updated_at`
- Resolved authorization checks
- Implemented proper payload filtering

## Learning Points
1. Supabase real-time payload structure differs from database schema
2. Importance of type guards for runtime safety
3. RLS policies crucial for secure real-time subscriptions
4. Filter conditions in channel subscription reduce unnecessary updates

## Next Steps
Potential improvements:
1. Customize toast notification appearance/duration
2. Add more ticket information to notifications
3. Implement notifications for other ticket events
4. Add sound/desktop notifications
5. Add notification history/log
